In this folder you can find all of my code and deliverables for weekly assignments throughout the NYU-Tandon Bridge Program for Computer Science, which I completed with distinction (4.0 GPA) in the winter of 2019. 

Within this folder there is a folder for each corresponding week of the program. Within each of the weekly folders there is either a pdf with the assignment instructions or a README file with the assignment propmt. In addition, all supporting files for that week's assignment can be found in each respective weekly folder as well.

**Please note that the program and the assignments are designed to increase in complexity over time. As such the assignments in week 1 may seem quite simple, but I would encourage you to take a look at the earlier weeks as well if you have the chance. Week 13 is known to be a challenging week in the program when students work on the doodlebug assignment.**
