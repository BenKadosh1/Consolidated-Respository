# Consolidated-Respository
Hi there, and welcome to my github page! My name is Ben Kadosh and I am currently a graduate student in Computer Science at Cornell Tech. I am passionate about making a difference, and believe technology is a great way to do so! Some of my major interests include Data Science, Health Tech, Computer Security, and Product Development. Prior to Cornell Tech I worked at PwC for 3.5 years and am also a CPA. 

In this consolidated repository you will find all of my academic work and projects from my time in the NYU-Tandon Computer Science Bridge Program and as a garaduate student at Cornell Tech. In addition, you will also find a folder with certifications from courses I have taken through Coursera. 

Should you have any questions please feel free to reach out!
